# Phishing URL Detector

A machine learning-powered web application that detects phishing URLs by analyzing their structural and linguistic features. Built with Streamlit, scikit-learn, and comprehensive feature extraction.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Feature Extraction**: Analyzes 25+ URL characteristics including length, special characters, domain properties, and suspicious patterns
- **Multiple ML Algorithms**: Supports Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression classifiers
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit dashboard with real-time analysis
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Detailed metrics, confusion matrices, and cross-validation results
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Understand which features contribute most to phishing detection
- **Real-time URL Testing**: Instant classification of individual URLs

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **URL Processing**: urllib, tld, regex

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-url-detector.git
cd phishing-url-detector
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

### 1. Dataset & Training
- Generate sample dataset or upload your own CSV file
- Extract features from URLs automatically
- Train multiple ML models simultaneously
- View training results and performance metrics

### 2. Model Evaluation
- Compare model performance across different algorithms
- View accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
- Analyze confusion matrices and classification reports

### 3. URL Testing
- Test individual URLs for phishing detection
- Get predictions from all trained models
- View detailed feature analysis for each URL
- Understand why a URL was classified as phishing or legitimate

### 4. Feature Analysis
- Explore feature importance for tree-based models
- Understand which URL characteristics are most predictive
- Analyze feature distributions and correlations

## Features Extracted

The system extracts the following features from URLs:

**Basic Properties:**
- URL length, number of dots, hyphens, slashes
- Special character counts
- Protocol detection (HTTP/HTTPS)

**Domain Analysis:**
- Domain length and subdomain count
- IP address detection
- TLD analysis and legitimacy
- Domain character patterns

**Path & Query Analysis:**
- Path length and segment count
- Query parameter analysis
- Suspicious file extensions

**Security Patterns:**
- Phishing keyword detection
- URL shortener identification
- Redirect pattern analysis
- Homograph attack detection

## Model Performance

The system typically achieves:
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% depending on the algorithm
- **Precision**: 80-90% for phishing detection
- **Recall**: 85-92% for legitimate URLs
- **F1-Score**: 85-90% balanced performance

## Data Requirements

For training, the system expects a CSV file with:
- `url` column: Contains the URLs to analyze
- `is_phishing` column: Binary labels (0 for legitimate, 1 for phishing)
